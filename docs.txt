Backend:

used express and mongoose.
totally only 4 routes

2 for register and login for users
2 for getting all the pins and creating a new pin oon the map.











Frontend:

Used poppins google font
Used MapBox for generating the map. Paid debit card info for using its api. username - madhav011 pw - urusualpassword
- while fetching the pins and displaying the pins on the map, the pins were visible. But on clciking the pins, the info abt 
that place wasn't showing. Tried for one full day but stil struggled a lot. After reading the docs, came to a solution that worked.
